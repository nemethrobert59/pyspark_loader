# PySpark Data Ingestion and Egestion Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to implementing PySpark for efficient data ingestion and egestion. It focuses on leveraging Apache Spark's powerful distributed data processing capabilities to handle large-scale data movement in and out of data systems.

## Features
- **PySpark Ingestion**: Streamline the process of data ingestion into data lakes or databases using PySpark.
- **PySpark Egestion**: Efficiently move data out of storage systems into various formats or systems.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for scalability, handling large volumes of data with Apache Spark.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilize PySpark's data processing functions for transforming data during ingestion and egestion.
